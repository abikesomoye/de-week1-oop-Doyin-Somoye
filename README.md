Data Epic Mentoring Program

**TERMS**
1. **ENCAPSULATION**: is a fundamental concept that involves bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) within a class while restricting direct access to some of the object's components. This ensures that sensitive data is protected and only accessible through controlled interfaces.

   *Key Features of Encapsulation*:
     + **Data Hiding**: Internal details of an object are hidden from the outside world, preventing unauthorized access or modification.
     + **Controlled Access**: Access to the object's data is provided through methods (getters and setters), ensuring proper validation and security.
     + **Improved Modularity**: Encapsulation helps in organizing code into logical units, making it easier to maintain and debug

    Python uses access modifiers to implement encapsulation:
     - **Public Members**: Accessible from anywhere (default behavior).
     - **Protected Members**: Indicated by a single underscore (_attribute), suggesting limited access (not enforced but a convention).
     - **Private Members**: Indicated by a double underscore (__attribute), restricting access to within the class.

**For this project:**
  *Encapsulation: we wiil make use of protected attributes such as **_catalog**, **_loans**.*

2. **INHERTITANCE**: is another fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows one class (called the child class or derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (called the parent class or base class). This promotes code reuse, modularity, and a hierarchical class structure.

   Inheritance includes:
     + Parent Class: The class being inherited from.
     + Child Class: The class that inherits from the parent class.

**For this project:** *To demonstrate inheritance **Member** child class and **Librarian** child class will inherit from **Person** parent class*
